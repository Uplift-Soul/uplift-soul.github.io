# INVST Gaming

**Twitch category intelligence — live viewership, audience concentration, and historical trends.**

🔗 **Live:** https://invstgaming.co.uk

INVST Gaming tracks the top categories (games) on Twitch: who's being watched right
now, how top-heavy each category is, and how viewership has shifted over time. A
Raspberry Pi collects snapshots every ~3 hours and publishes them as JSON to a static
site on GitHub Pages.

## Pages

- **Overview** (`/`) — headline KPIs, a per-category viewership trend (daily peak,
  7-day smoothed), and top-10 concentration over time.
- **Live** (`/live`) — the latest snapshot's top categories (ranked by Twitch), the
  streamers behind each, and a *fragility* ranking (how much a category leans on its
  top 10 streamers).
- **Historical** (`/historical`) — category rank changes month to month, and the
  biggest viewership risers/fallers (current month-to-date vs the same dates two
  years earlier).

## Architecture

```
Twitch Helix API
      │  every ~3h (cron on a Raspberry Pi)
      ▼
  collector ──► PostgreSQL ──► publish.py ──► *.json
                                              │  git commit + push
                                              ▼
                                  GitHub Pages (Actions) ──► invstgaming.co.uk
```

- A **collector** queries Twitch's Helix API (top 50 categories + their streams) and
  writes snapshots into **PostgreSQL** on the Pi.
- **`publish.py`** reads the database and emits the JSON the frontend consumes, then
  commits and pushes.
- The **frontend** is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no build step) plus Chart.js. It fetches
  the JSON and auto-refreshes every 90 seconds.
- **Deployment** is a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) with
  `cancel-in-progress`, so the frequent data pushes never jam the deploy queue.

> The collector and `publish.py` run only on the Pi and are **gitignored** (they hold
> database/API credentials), so they are not part of this repository.

## Data & methodology

- **Everything is concurrent viewers.** Twitch's API reports how many people are
  watching at the moment of each snapshot — there is no "hours watched" or unique-
  viewer figure.
- **Trends and movers use the daily _peak_** (the busiest moment each day), not a flat
  average. The pre-2026 archive only sampled ~09:00–23:00 while the live feed samples
  24/7, so a daily average makes the live era read artificially low. Both eras
  reliably capture the evening peak, so peak-to-peak is a fair comparison.
- **Concentration / fragility** is a ratio: a category's top-10 streamers' viewers ÷
  its total viewers.
- The collector captures the **top 50 categories** per snapshot; the dashboard
  surfaces the top 20.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) (+ date-fns
  adapter), hosted on GitHub Pages.
- **Backend (on the Pi):** Python (`requests`, `psycopg2`), PostgreSQL, cron.

## Local development

It's a static site — just serve the folder:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

Clean URLs (`/live`, `/historical`) are a GitHub Pages feature; locally use the
`.html` form (`/live.html`).

## Conventions

- **Clean URLs** — link internally without `.html` (`/live`, not `live.html`). A new
  page must link clean *and* be registered in the `common.js` command palette.
- **Cache busting** — bump the `?v=N` query on `assets/style.css` / `assets/common.js`
  whenever they change.
- **Deploy** — every push to `main` triggers the Pages Actions workflow.
